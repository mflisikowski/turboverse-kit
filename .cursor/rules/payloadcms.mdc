Before starting any tasks, display “💥 PAYLOADCMS rule working:” and read all the documentation of the request.

Analyze all packages located in payload/payload-*, and create a file tree (excluding unnecessary files like node_modules, etc.) to stay updated on the Payload CMS structure in the project.

Remember to import all PayloadCMS-related packages using @repo/payload-*.

Run the script to generate types by navigating to payload/payload-config. The script you need to run is “generate:types”. Once the process is complete, display “💥 PAYLOADCMS types generated”.

Before finishing, display “💥 PAYLOADCMS rule finished”.
